## JavaSECSTools
This project produces a library that contains a collection of classes and utilities that are useful in the creation and manipulation of data(messages) that are in SEMI SECS-II format.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

This project is only really appropriate for those that are working primarily in the realm of shop floor automation in the semiconductor industry. If you do not work in that industry or you are not familiar with the SEMI Standards **E4**, **E5**, **E30**, **E37**, el al, this project is probably not for you.

## jvulkan
This project provides Java programs access to the Vulkan® SDK available from LunarG.  This access to the Vulkan® SDK is provided in a much more Java friendly manner than other currently available options.  Find it here <a href="https://github.com/dkaip/jvulkan">https://github.com/dkaip/jvulkan</a>.

## jvulkan-natives-Linux-x86_64
This project is what provides the intermediate layer or the go between layer between the **jvulkan** Java API and the 
Vulkan® SDK available from LunarG. This project is actually a project written in C++, however, since it is basically meaningless without the jvulkan project it is mentioned here. Find it here <a href="https://github.com/dkaip/jvulkan-natives-Linux-x86_64">https://github.com/dkaip/jvulkan-natives-Linux-x86_64</a>.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

Currently, there is only support available for Linux-x86_64 environments.

This project is what provides the intermediate layer or the go between layer between the **jvma** Java API and the 
Vulkan® Memory Allocator. This project is actually a project written in C++, however, since it is basically meaningless without the jvma project it is mentioned here. Find it here <a href="https://github.com/dkaip/jvma-natives-Linux-x86_64">https://github.com/dkaip/jvma-natives-Linux-x86_64</a>.
