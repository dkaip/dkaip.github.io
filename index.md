# Welcome to my home page on GitHub!
{: .fs-9 }

From here you should be able to access and get more information about my public projects and my thoughts pertaining to certain topics. Hopefully, some of them will be of use to you.  My public projects are currently focused in two areas.  
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

The first area may be of interest to those working in the domain of automating Semiconductor Manufacturing facilities (via software).  If you are not familiar with the [SEMI Standards](https://www.semi.org/en/standards) like **E4**, **E5**, **E30**,
**E37**, et al, these projects are probably not for you.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

The second area has to do with the **Vulkan&reg;** API that comes from [The Kronos Group, Inc.](https://www.khronos.org)  The Vulkan&reg; API \"is a cross-platform industry standard enabling developers to target a wide range of devices with the same graphics API\".  If you are not trying to use the Vulkan&reg; API to access/operate/control your 3D graphics card you will probably not be interested in these projects.
